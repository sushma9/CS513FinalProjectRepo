## YesWorkflow Overview

There are three four main YW workflows we include in this portion of the repo. 
1. `outer_workflow.yw` - Overall data cleaning and processing workflow of the project.
2. `inner_workflow_r.yw` - Detailed view into the tables we cleaned using R. 
3. `inner_workflow_dish_or.yw` - Using [or2yw](https://github.com/LanLi2017/OR2YWTool) tool, the OpenRefine operations we used for the dish table. 
4. `inner_workflow_menu_or.yw` - Using [or2yw](https://github.com/LanLi2017/OR2YWTool) tool, the OpenRefine operations we used for the menu table.
